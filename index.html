        <p>Hello! My name is Kingsley Kwarteng and I'm from Ghana, West Africa. I am the last born in my family of nine.
            I love taking long walks and hiking in the wild where nature sorrounds and it's always a wonderful
             oppotunity when I see the mavelous work of God in my life, I also like soccer and basketball alot.
             Reading is very essential to human growth and I love reading factual elements, the scritures especially,
             the The Book Of Mormon and other Novels that have interesting stories. I served as a full time missionary at Nigeria Owerri Mission
             and enjoyed my best two years ever even when Covid hit, the love for others even grew immensely and the desire to serve was still being manifested by
             the vibrant missionaries I had which strengthened my faith which has helped me a lot even as I returned from mission as I count my blessings everyday, 
             I always live thankfully and cheerfully which keeps me going!</p>
